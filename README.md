## My [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com "Sublime Text") configuration files

I like keeping my customizations to the minimum.

#### About the *settings* section
- The **theme** is just a personal preference (I included it anyways).
- The **tab_size** and **translate_tabs_to_spaces** is important to be common for all the team members (the values are up to you).

#### About the *keybinding* section
- The navigation (prev_view / next_view) is basically google chrome's choice, not mine.
- The multi-cursor handlers (select_lines-forward:true / select_lines-forward:false) is written in my dna after 4 years of usage.
